Version 1.0.1

1. Previous version can not be compiled with lcc (pointed by Andrew
Hutchinson). Now this can be done.

Version 1.0.2

2. Previous version can not be compiled with gcc (pointed by Belinda Thom and Michel Beaulieu). 
Now I hope this can be done. 

Version 1.0.3

3. There was a strange garbage string in file p_demo.m (pointed by Jani Lahtinen).
This bug is fixed.

Version 1.0.4

4. I deleted mxx.m and mexme.m files because using them led to some problems.
Now installation procedure is longer but clearer (I suppose) (see contents.m)
(thanks to Joe Groner and Jose Suarez)

5. Some things clarifying joint using pointers library and DSATX
is added to documentation (contents.m) (thanks to Omar Kofahi and Peters, R.J.M.)

Some bugs related to memory leackage (pointed by Christoph Henninger) 
are fixed.
