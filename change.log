Version 1.0.1

1. Previous version can not be compiled with lcc (pointed by Andrew
Hutchinson). Now this can be done.

Version 1.0.2

2. Previous version can not be compiled with gcc (pointed by Belinda Thom
and Michel Beaulieu). Now I hope this can be done.

Version 1.0.3

3. There was a strange garbage string in file p_demo.m (pointed by Jani
Lahtinen). This bug is fixed.

Version 1.0.4

4. I deleted mxx.m and mexme.m files because using them led to some
problems. Now installation procedure is longer but clearer (I suppose) (see
contents.m) (thanks to Joe Groner and Jose Suarez)

5. Some things clarifying joint using pointers library and DSATX is added
to documentation (contents.m) (thanks to Omar Kofahi and Ralph Peters)

6. I repaired subsref.m and subsasgn.m. Christoph Henninger and Gang Liang
pointed out some bugs in them. Thanks a lot to Gang Liang for helpfull
suggestions. Now you can use long expressions uncluding pointers subfields
such as
  a = pointer
  a.data1.data2.data3 = 'abc'
etc.
